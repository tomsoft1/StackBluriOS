This is a StackBlur implementation for iOS based on the algorithm of:

by Mario Klingemann

To use it, just import the UIImage+StackBlur.h and .m in your project.

Then, to blur an image:

UIImage *newIma=[oldIma stackBlur:radius];

You can also apply the method to a buffer directly if you dont'have access to the full UIImage (see applyStackBlurToBuffer)

The algorithm expect an RGBA format (32 bits/pixel).
If it's not the case, the image will be transformed in a 32 bits/pixel format at each call. You can also use the [UIImage normalize] function of the library to do it once

UIImage *myIma=[[UIImage imageNamed:@"blackWhite.png"] normalized];

...
UIImage *blurIma=[myIm stackBlur:radius];

Radius must be higher than 1 ...
